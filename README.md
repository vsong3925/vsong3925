### FEATURED PROJECTS

#### MLB Forecast Model
This project involves assessing a dataset containing all pitches from the 2011 MLB season and related metadata to build a predictive model. The goal is to predict the probability of the next pitch being a fastball, slider, change-up, or other pitch types. 

#### Interactive Web Dashboard
The StockBoard is an interactive dashboard that provides users insights into the stock market performance in the past, present and future. It also enables users to dynamically select sectors, stock and date range to compare and visualize the stock performance. This project used Javascript to set up dropdown buttons for users to filter data and set parameters. It used Javascript (D3.js) and Plotly to visualize stock performance data. Machine Learning (Facebook Prophet library) is incorporated to predict stock market performance in the next 365 days and Tableau is used to visualize the prediction data. The data analytics and visualizations were hosted in a responsive website (built by using HTML, Bootstrap and CSS) that was deployed in Heroku. Other skills and techniques involved in this project include: Python (analyzing data), Flask (rendering HTML template), the AWS cloud database (data migration).

#### Leaflet Map Visualization
This project used Leaflet to visualize earthquake data retrieved from the United State Geological Survey (USGS) GeoJSON Feed. The map displays the earthquake's magnitudes, size and depth. It also provides more information (time and location) and another map layer to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. Users can select different layers for visualization.
