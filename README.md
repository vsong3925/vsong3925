### FEATURED PROJECTS
#### Advanced Excel
This project organized and analyzed a database of 4,000 past Kickstarter projects. To analyze the data and uncover Kickstarter market trends, I used conditional formatting and Excel formulas to distinguish the project states (success, live, fail) and percentage funded. Using date format conversion, column splits and other advanced excel analytical techniques to transform the data I was able to reveal hidden trends. To visualize the data and summarize the trends, I used pivot tables, with filters and parameters and dynamic pivot charts (line plot and bar chart), to display market trends which included project states per category and sub-category, outcomes based on launch dates, and other key data points.

- Role: Role: sole performer, data analyst
- Tools: advanced Excel, pivot tables and pivot charts 

#### Leaflet Map Visualization
This project used Leaflet to visualize earthquake data retrieved from the United State Geological Survey (USGS) GeoJSON Feed. The map displays the earthquake's magnitudes, size and depth. It also provides more information (time and location) and another map layer to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity. Users can select different layers for visualization.
